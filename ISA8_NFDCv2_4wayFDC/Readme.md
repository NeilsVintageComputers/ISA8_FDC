# NFDC V2.0 ISA8 FDC

This FDC is based on the Sergey Monster FDC, and uses the Sergey FDC Bios.

I have cut it down to a 4-way controller, similar to the NFDC V1.0, and added a edge connector option for the first pair of drives and a external 37-pin connector option using standard IBM pin connection that can be used for the second pair of drives.
